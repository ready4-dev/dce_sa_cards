# dce_sa_cards
HTML choice cards for use in pilot and final Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) surveys of socially anxious young people

The choice cards were used in a DCE that is currently being written up for publication. A link to details of that study will be provided once they become publicly available.

The HTML choice cards used for the pilot survey are located in the "Pilot_Survey" directory and those used in the finalised survey instrument are in the "Final_Survey" directory. For both surveys, choice cards were organised into two blocks of 15 choice cards each. 

The code used to generate the choice cards is available as part of the dce_sa_design program which is available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6626256
